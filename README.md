## Overview

This project represents a library system where users can search for books by title, author, or genre and check their availability. It also includes the logic for managing bookings, though the feature to add new reservations through the interface is not yet implemented.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for books by title, author, or genre using a dynamic search bar.
- **Book Details**: Displays information about books, including title, author, genre, and availability.
- **Booking Management**: Includes a class-based system to handle bookings and update book availability dynamically.
- **Interactive UI**: A clean and responsive interface for browsing books.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For implementing dynamic behavior and the library logic.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/public-library.git


## Observations

Due to time constraints, the feature to integrate a form for adding reservations via the UI was not completed. However, the logic for handling bookings is fully implemented in the JavaScript classes and can be extended or tested programmatically.

## Future Improvements

 Add Booking Form: Integrate a form in the UI to allow users to add new bookings.
Database Integration: Store book and booking data in a database for persistence.
User Authentication: Implement user login and registration features for a personalized experience.
Improved UI/UX: Enhance the design and make the interface more intuitive.
